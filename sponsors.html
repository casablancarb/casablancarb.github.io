<h1>Some of the folks who support our community.</h1>
<p>These are the businesses that have given back to the community for our monthly meetings.</p>

<p>If you'd like to sponsor a meeting to promote your product/service or get the word out that your hiring then it's as easy as posting "Hi all, I'd like to sponsor one of the meetings." to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/urug">mailing List</a>.</p>
